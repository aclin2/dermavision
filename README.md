# DermaVision

Generates a diverse dataset of ezcema images on dark skin using StyleGAN3, and includes a classifier for identifying eczema after.

## Description

Our dataset of Dark Skin with ezcema is stored in Darker_Skin.RGB and is taken from multiple datasets, mostly Dermnet.com, our classifier for ezcema/not eczema is labeled as Skin_Classifier, and the main classifier is labeled as stylegan3. The other files were helper funcitons for parsing the data we used.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

We used Google Colab notebooks and would recommend running it on one as it requires GPU.


## Help
